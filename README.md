DigitalCrafts: Learning LocalStorage



<b>Overall:</b>
- CoffeeRun's primary learning experience was working with localstorage and APIs.
- The first goal was to save to our personal localstorage.
- From there, I worked with an API that our instructor provided. 
- This created the ability to work with an API on a smaller scale and learn how obtain the necessary data.
- Styling was optional; however, personally, I enjoy going back and fourth from HTML and CSS to JavaScript, Ajax, and jQuery.


<b>Difficulties:</b>
- This project was my first incounter with APIs. Using another database with nested objects that I didn't personally create was interesting. Great learning experience to read through code and figure out how to extract the data needed.
